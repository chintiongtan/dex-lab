## Solving Deployment Friction with Multi-Zone Micro-Frontends

A simple and scalable approach with Next.js

---

## Today's Deployment Flow


* Weekly scheduled release
* Code from multiple teams
* Shared ownership over a single monolith

---

## What's Not Working Well?

* ❗ **Coordination overhead**
  * *Teams blocked by each other*

* 🐛 **Fault isolation**
  * *Hard to pinpoint and roll back issues*

* 🕒 **Slow iteration**
  * *Features wait days to go live*

* ❓ **Unclear ownership**
  * *Bugs shared across teams*

---

## What Good Looks Like?

* ✅ Teams deploy independently
* ✅ Isolated failures
* ✅ Fast release cycles
* ✅ Clear ownership and responsibility

---

## What Are Micro-Frontends?

* A frontend architecture pattern where each team owns a portion of the UI
* Inspired by microservices but for the browser
* Teams can build, test and deploy independently

---

## Multi-Zone Support in Next.js

* Each zone = a separate Next.js app
* Combined under a parent / root app via reverse proxy or rewrites
